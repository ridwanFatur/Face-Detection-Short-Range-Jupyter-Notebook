# Face Detection with Media Pipe (TFLite) in Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates how to perform object detection using the **Face Detection Short Range** model from **Media Pipe**, running inside a Jupyter Notebook. The model is used in its **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** format for lightweight and fast inference.

## üéØ What This Notebook Does

The notebook walks through the process of:
- Loading a Face Detection model in TFLite format
- Reading and preparing an image for inference
- Running object detection
- Displaying the image with detected faces

This is intended for basic experimentation and learning.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run This Notebook

### 1. Install Jupyter Notebook

If you haven‚Äôt already:
```bash
pip install notebook
```

### 2. Launch the Notebook
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. Open the Notebook File

Navigate to the notebook file `Face Detection Short Range.ipynb` and open it in the Jupyter interface.

### 4. Run the Cells

Use the **"Run"** button to execute each cell one by one.

## üìÅ Required Files

Make sure the following files are in the same directory:

- `Face Detection Short Range.ipynb` ‚Äî the main Jupyter Notebook  
- `face_detection_short_range.tflite` ‚Äî the Face Detection Short Range TFLite model from Mediapipe 
- `sample_face.jpg` ‚Äî a test image to run detection on
